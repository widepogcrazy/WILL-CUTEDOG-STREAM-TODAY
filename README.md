# üéâ CuteDog_ Streaming Prediction Competition üéâ

## Overview
Welcome to the CuteDog_ Streaming Prediction Competition! üöÄ In this challenge, participants will predict the days when the popular Twitch streamer [CuteDog_](https://www.twitch.tv/cutedog_) will go live. This competition is open to all data enthusiasts, machine learning practitioners, and fans of CuteDog_ who want to test their skills in predictive modeling.

## Goal
The goal of this competition is to accurately predict whether or not CuteDog_ will stream on any given day, based on historical streaming patterns, contextual data, and other relevant features.

## Dataset
The base dataset provided includes historical information about CuteDog_‚Äôs streaming schedule over the past few years. It contains various features that may influence streaming behavior, including:
- **Date**: Specific day (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
- **Viewer Numbers**: How many people watched the stream. DONT BE A VIEW ANDY THO
- **Stream Length**: Average duration of stream. But none was a 24 hour stream Sadge
- **Games Played**: The games played in recent streams. Do note he usually forgets to change game category

## Do note that many of the features are referring to the information from the LAST STREAM (i.e the row on 2023/11/01 will reference stream information from the last available stream, i.e 2023/10/31). Keep a lookout on the feature names for more info!

## To add:
- **Announcement Indicators**: Additional indicators on his discord channel to indicate whether he was "AWAKEGE" or whether he has consumed chicken/pasta.

You will use these features to create a machine learning model that predicts whether CuteDog_ will stream on a given day.

## Competition Structure
1. **Download the Dataset**: Get access to the dataset by [downloading it here](#). Ensure you have the necessary data processing tools installed.
2. **Build Your Model**: Use any machine learning techniques you like‚Äîclassification models, time-series forecasting, etc.‚Äîto predict the target variable, **Stream** (1 = streamed, 0 = no stream).
3. **Submit Your Predictions**: Submit a CSV file with your predicted results for each day FROM 2024/10/05 TO 2024/11/05 TO DETERMINE THE WINNER

## Evaluation Metric
Submissions will be evaluated using **Accuracy**. The higher your accuracy in predicting CuteDog_‚Äôs streaming days, the better your score!

## Submission Format
Please format your submission as a CSV file with the following structure:

Here's the updated template with added details for **Prizes** and **Rules**:

```

2023-01-02,0
2023-01-03,1
```

## Prizes üèÜ
The top 3 participants with the highest accuracy scores will receive:
1. **First Place**: $50,000 cash prize, kiss from pogchammp herself and a shoutout from CuteDog_ on his stream! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2. **Second Place**: A Guest Appearance on Stream! üëÄ

1. **Single Submission per Day**: You can submit your predictions once daily.
2. **Original Work**: All code and models submitted must be your original work. Plagiarism will lead to disqualification.
3. **No Overfitting on Test Data**: Ensure that your models generalize well and do not overfit to specific test data.
4. **Fair Play**: This competition is for fun and learning! Please refrain from using unethical practices, such as using data leakage or exploiting the scoring system.
5. **Public Submissions Only**: All top submissions must be publicly available in the repository to ensure reproducibility.
